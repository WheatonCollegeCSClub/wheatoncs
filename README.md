###How to build your own website
1. Create your own page with the format ``your-name.html`` in the ``members`` folder.
2. Follow the template in ``tri.html`` to see how different elements (links, stylesheets etc.) are pulled in and follow. 
3. Feel free to make changes and add anything within the ``<div class="page">`` element.
4. Create your own ``your-name.css`` stylesheet in the ``css`` folder. Remember to link this stylesheet to your specific html page by replacing ``<link rel=stylesheet" href="../css/tri.css">`` with your own.
5. Add your own preview on the homepage by following the template of ``<div class="member-preview">`` in ``index.html``
