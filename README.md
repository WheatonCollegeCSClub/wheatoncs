###How to run it locally
You can easily do a ``git clone`` to download the code to your computer. Since this is just HTML/CSS/JavaScript, any computer with a browser will be able to render.

###How to push changes to the live site
Changes to the site could be made through ``pull requests``.
1. ``fork`` this repo,
2. make changes to it as much as you would like, then
3. create a ``pull request``.

###How to build your own website
1. Create your own page with the format ``your-name.html`` in the ``members`` folder.
2. Follow the template in ``tri.html`` to see how different elements (links, stylesheets etc.) are pulled in and follow.
3. Feel free to make changes and add anything within the ``<div class="page">`` element.
4. Create your own ``your-name.css`` stylesheet in the ``css`` folder. Remember to link this stylesheet to your specific html page by replacing ``<link rel=stylesheet" href="../css/tri.css">`` with your own.
5. Add your own preview on the homepage by following the template of ``<div class="member-preview">`` in ``index.html``
6. If you have any question, feel free to [contact Tri](mailto:nguyen_tri@wheatonma.edu) or [create an issue](https://github.com/tnguyen14/wheatoncs/issues).
